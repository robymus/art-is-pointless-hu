ART IS POINTLESS<br>
YOU HAVE TO GO OUT<br>
GET AN ACTUAL JOB<br>
AND MAKE A LIVING<br>
YOU CAN'T JUST LET<br>
THE REST OF YOUR FILE<br>
BE A JOKE, A FAILURE.<br>
YOU WILL END UP<br>
A STARVING ARTIST.<br>
CONTRIBUTE TO SOCIETY<br>
INSTEAD OF WASTING TIME<br>
YOU'RE WORTHLESS.<br>
          </div></div>
  				<div id="right"><div>
<br>
WITHOUT PASSION.<br>
AND CREATE ART.<br>
DOING WHAT YOU LOVE<br>
BY BEING YOURSELF.<br>
OTHER PEOPLE DEFINE<br>
AND SAY YOU WILL<br>
FOLLOW YOUR HEART.<br>
HAPPY AND FREE, NOT<br>
LOVE YOUR ART AND<br>
BY INSPIRING PEOPLE<br>
LETTING OTHERS TELL YOU<br>
YOU CAN CHANGE THE WORLD.<br>
